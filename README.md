# Hide_and_seek_ros

### Hello team, don't forget to follow the tutorials before starting development.

* **Idea** - The hider maps the terrain and finds the best place to hide and the seeker tries to find the hider in the shortest time possible.

* **Idea** - Expand hide and seek game to a _visibility based pursuit and evasion_ in which there are two robots - one is the pursuer and one the evader -> the purpose is that the pursuer tries to find the evader before the evader finds the exit from an enviroment (maze).

#### Basic functionalities:

* Navigation(Mech) and Enviroment Mapping(LIDAR)
* Object Detection and Recognition(Camera)
* Finding efficient paths through the enviroment(Algo)

##### Abbreviations
* Image Processing (Object detection and recognition) --> (IP)

* Integration (Making all the modules work together) --> (Int)
* Navigation and Enviroment mapping --> (Nav)
* Documentation and Presentatios --> (Docs)
